# winc_hpteam_scraping
The list of Waseda University circles can be obtained by scraping in Python and the results can be output to an Excel file.

We are using the current 2023/05/06 latest version of Selenium. It is recommended to install the latest version of Chrome Driver. For more information, please visit the official website.
This code has a drawback that if the specified one does not exist, only the processing of that page will be slow for about 5 seconds. Well, if you want fast scraping in the first place, you probably don't want to use Python, lol.

, the Chrome Driver path is the path on the editor's environment, so please set your own path. It is also noted on the code just in case.
